# Medical Image Enhancement 🩻✨

This project is a **Medical Image Enhancement Studio** built with Python.  
It provides two essential techniques for improving visibility of medical images:

- **Histogram Equalization** – improves contrast by redistributing pixel intensity values.  
- **Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation** – enhances details by controlling brightness and contrast.  

## 🚀 Features
- Simple Tkinter GUI interface
- Upload and preview medical images
- Apply Histogram Equalization
- Apply Gamma Transformation (with user-controlled gamma values)
- Display before/after results and histograms
- Export enhanced images for reports
