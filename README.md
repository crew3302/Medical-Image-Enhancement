# Medical Image Enhancement 🩻✨

This project is a **Medical Image Enhancement Studio** built with Python.  
It provides two essential techniques for improving visibility of medical images:

- **Histogram Equalization** – improves contrast by redistributing pixel intensity values.  
- **Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation** – enhances details by controlling brightness and contrast.  

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ **Dual Enhancement Techniques**  
  - **Histogram Equalization** – automatic, high-impact contrast improvement.  
  - **Gamma Transformation** – manual brightness and tonal range control.  

- 🖥️ **Interactive GUI** – clean Tkinter interface with real-time image updates.  
- 📊 **Instant Histogram Analysis** – compare pixel distribution before and after.  
- ⚡ **Side-by-Side Comparison** – visualize enhancement results instantly.  
- 💾 **Export Functionality** – save enhanced images and histograms for reports.  
- ⌨️ **CLI Mode** – batch process images or integrate into pipelines.
